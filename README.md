Individual flowchart 

I chose to make a flowchart based on my miniex? because I found that to be the most complex one. Others might not think that. But I find it complex because it is much more complicated than it looks and I spent a lot of time making it (with a lot of help). I chose to make a flowchart that represents what you can actually see. My flowchart just describes it more literally.
